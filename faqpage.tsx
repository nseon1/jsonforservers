    question: "How are servers scored?",
    answer: "Servers are scored on a scale of 0-10 based on multiple factors including activity level, quality of discussions, and mostly vibes. All scored by me, seon."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the T-SNE view?",
    answer: "T-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a visualization technique that places similar servers closer together on a 2D map. This helps you discover servers that are similar to ones you already like. It looks cool."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Quadrant view work?",
    answer: "The Quadrant view lets you select two tags and see how servers are distributed based on whether they have those tags or not. It also looks cool."
